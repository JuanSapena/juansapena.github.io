Richard Ferdinand Kahn (1905-1989) most notable contribution to economics was his principle of the multiplier.
The multiplier is the relation between the increase in aggregate expenditure and the increase in net national product (output).
It is the increase in aggregate expenditure (for example government spending) that causes the increase in output (or income)
